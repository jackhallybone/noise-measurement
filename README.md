# Noise Measurement

A basic implementation of frequency- and time-weighting filters for sound level calculation according to IEC 61672-1 (2002), based on on the publicly available reprint [IS 15575 (Part 1): 2005](https://law.resource.org/pub/in/bis/S04/is.15575.1.2005.pdf).

Intended to form the basis of an embedded implementation to come.

`pytest`ed against some of the performance criteria outlined in the standard.
